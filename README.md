# Model reduction of neural induction in ascidian embryo
The Python-code regarding my Bachelorthesis about a model reduction of the neural induction in ascidian embryo.

The file called "MAPK-LoadData" is a file with all the data, without calculating them again. For the code to work, all .txt files should be downloaded, as they use them to load the data.
The file called "MAPK-final" is the file where all calculations are performed, together with saving this data into .txt files.

If there are any questions regarding the code, please e-mail me via Nathan.Eddy.Van.Dam@vub.be

Best regards,
Nathan van Dam
